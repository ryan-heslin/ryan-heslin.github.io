      <description>This post contains spoilers for some 2021 Advent of Code puzzles. Proceed at your own risk.
If you haven’t heard of Advent of Code, it’s well worth your time to check out. Created and maintained by software engineer Eric Wastl, it’s an annual event involving an advent calendar of Christmas-themed programming challenges. Anyone can participate for free, anonymously if they like. A new puzzle is released on each of the first 25 days of December, starting out simple and gradually increasing in difficulty.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog! My name is Ryan Heslin, and I just graduated with a master’s degree in data science from American University. As I do for most of my side projects, I’ve defined goals for this one. Naturally, I’ve made them just clear enough that I can plausibly deny working on this thing is procrastination. serves goals I’ve defined just clearly that enough I can plausibly deny working on it is procrastination.</description>

      <description>My name is Ryan Heslin. I recently graduated with a master&amp;rsquo;s in data science from American University. While I know Python, SQL, and bits of Lua, my main (and favorite) language is R. This blog is devoted to discussing R and its quirks, as well as data science generally. For more odds and ends, visit my GitHub.
Made with the Blogdown package, which implements the Hugo site generation template. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>
