# Welcome
Welcome to my blog! My name is Ryan Heslin, and I recently graduated from
American University with a master's in data science. While I work in Python
and a few other languages, my main (and favorite) is R. For now, I'll devote this
blog to my musings (or ramblings, if you feel uncharitable) on R and other topics
related to data science.

# Why the Name?
Naming things really is as hard as cache invalidation. I spent a long time casting about for something
to call the site before hitting on Verso. It means the reverse side of a
physical document, such as the left-hand page of a book. The word attracted me
because I aim to make this blog like a good anthology: you can visit any page and find
something short but worth reading.
As a publishing term derived from Italian, it has a pleasingly archaic resonance similar to "quarto",
the namesake of the file format this site's documents are written in. Most important,
it's got an R.

Verso was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed using Github Pages with
a standard Quarto [GitHub workflow](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command). A previous version of this site was built with rendered Rmarkdown and the
`blogdown` R package.
