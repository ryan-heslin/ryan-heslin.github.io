Today brought another breather puzzle. You're given a series of matrices like this:

```
#.##..##.
..#.##.#.
##......#
##......#
..#.##.#.
..##..##.
#.#.##.#.

#...##..#
#....#..#
..##..###
#####.##.
#####.##.
..##..###
#....#..#
```
You have to find the vertical and horizontal line of symmetry in each. In the 
first example above, the vertical line is after the fourth column. Part two 
adds the twist that each matrix has a hidden line of symmetry, one that holds 
if just one element is altered. This is easy to compute by converting the character matrices 
to numeric, adding the reflected elements 
and checking if the sum is one.
