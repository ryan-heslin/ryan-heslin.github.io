For the penultimate puzzle, we are given coordinates and velocities representing 
the positions of a few hundred hailstones. Given position vector $\vec p_i$ and velocity vector $\vec v_i$,  
the position of hailstone $i$ at time $t$ can be calculated by $\vec p_{ti} = \vec {p_i} + t \vec {v_i}$. 

Part 1 asks how many of their paths will intersect at some point in the future, ignoring the $z$. This
is easy to brute-force by trying to solve for the intersection of every pair of lines and 
throwing out solutions where $t \leq 0$.

Part 2 asks for something vastly harder: the sum of the position coordinates for the 
equation of a line that intersects all hailstones (not just the lines they trace) at 
some point in the future. Even assuming integer coordinates, brute force is out of 
the question. As with most things in life, the best solution comes through complicated linear 
algebra. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18q40he/2023_day_24_part_2_a_straightforward_nonsolver/) explains the algorithm I used.

Linear algebra rarely appears in Advent of Code, perhaps because floating-point error 
is a serious concern in matrix arithmetic, so it's good to see it represented.
