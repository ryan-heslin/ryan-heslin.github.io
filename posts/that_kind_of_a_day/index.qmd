The `lintr` package, a widely used [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) for R code, prefers that you use snake
case for object names. That includes R core:

![](/img/dotcase.png){fig-alt="Too bad the base namespace is locked"}

In fairness, `is.numeric` _ought_ to be called `is_numeric`, because dots are
supposed to be reserved for S3 methods. R breaks this rule all the time, leading to
names like `as.data.frame.data.frame`. R updates are named after _Peanuts_ strips;
getting dinged by the linter for using a base function is something
that would happen to Charlie Brown if he ever took up programming.

As you might guess from the traceback thirty calls deep on the right of the screen,
this wasn't a great day. But I can't help but smile when I see a linter commit
heresy.
