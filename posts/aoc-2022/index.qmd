# Overview

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is over. After a few frantic
weeks, I've completed both parts of all 25 puzzles.
And, like most years, it was a wild ride, full of frustration and triumph in equal
measure.
When I wasn't coding, I was scanning documentation or trawling the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) to  ~~look at memes~~ find suggestions for better algorithms.
To my surprise, I managed to finish the whole calendar before the New Year. The year felt a little easier than 2021, though of course
I have much more experience than I did then.

This year's narrative had the player assisting the Elves' expedition deep into
the jungle, in search of a rare fruit that powers the reindeer's flight.
This premise has lower stakes than most years, which require you to
prevent some catastrophe from ruining Christmas, but the change of pace is welcome.
We all know the plot is just a device to string puzzle premises together,
but I make special note of it because I think it's the secret to Advent of
Code's popularity. Problems are just more _fun_ when framed with a silly scenario.
"Find the path on this unidirected graph maximizing this dynamic weighting function"
is a work specification; "Find how to open the right valves to release as
much pressure as possible so you and the herd of elephants following you can
escape the erupting volcano" is _fun_.

(One other amusing consequence of the narrative: if you follow the common
style advice to name variables and functions in terms of the problem you are
modeling, your code will teem with names like `ModulusMonkey` and `nearest_elf`).

# Methods

If this year had a theme, it was [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). Every year has at least a few puzzles involving them,
but they showed up again and again this year. The concept often appeared
with a clever twist, such as modeling falling shapes (Day 17) or computing
three-dimensional surface areas (day 18).

For these types of problems, I like to use a sparse map that
stores only coordinates with some property of interest specified by the problem
description. For day 18, for example, this was coordinates covered by a falling shape.
I used to use tuples to represent coordinates, but now I use a tried-and-true hack: complex
numbers. Not only is this trick effective, it gives me the guilty thrill of
using a workaround it would be reckless to use in production code.

As always, a few problems frustrated me. Day 9 caught
me off guard. It's tricky, but nothing terrible: each knot on the rope
follows simple movement rules that you can infer by studying the example input.
Instead, I developed a complicated solution for part 1 that wouldn't
generalize to part 2. The problem became easy when I took a break and realized
all I had to do was keep each knot adjacent to its leading knot.

Day 11 stymied me for a different reason: it could be solved a simple trick that
I _just couldn't see_. Part 2 introduces a rule change that allows certain values
to grow without bound. You have to recognize that they follow a cycle whose period
is the lowest common multiple of divisors specified in the problem, then
modulo divide by that value. This isn't too hard to figure out, but I didn't
spend enough time planning an approach. I ended up finding the correct method
only after trying almost everything else. A little number theory would have saved me
a lot of trouble.

I also got badly stuck on day 16, but that one was horrible for everyone, so
there's nothing to analyze.

# Difficulty

I think the puzzle design this year was perhaps the best yet. Many puzzles
were hard, some very hard, but none were complicated.
The best-designed puzzles test insight and ability to to
adapt a useful algorithm to a novel situation.
Those with complicated rules introduce an additional challenge: correctly implementing every
detail of the specification. This rewards diligence more than insight and
means even tiny mistakes will yield the wrong answer. Complication isn't _unfair per
se, and most real software specifications are very complicated. But
few people consider attending to minutiae the best part of programming;
consider the mixed reception to [2018 day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/15), which I'm not even brave enough to attempt.

This year, the hard puzzles were hard because a straightforward approach could not solve them. Days 16 and 19, probably the hardest, presented
tough pathfinding scenarios. You had to wrangle each input into a graph structure (possibly implicit),
then find a way to reduce the problem space to a manageable size.
Without some clever optimization, any solution would probably take much too long
Both tasks involve lateral thinking and creativity; implementing Wikipedia's Dijkstra pseudocode wouldn't cut it.
Some puzzles involved simulation, but not
with complicated rules; the difficulty instead came from understanding
the subtleties in the interaction of simple rules (e.g., Day 9).
Overall, the puzzles have become leaner but no less challenging. I appreciate
the work it must have taken to refine a successful formula and make it still better.

I also encountered, or implemented for the first time, several other useful
techniques: cycle detection, bit-encoding subsets, flood-filling, and more.
I never come out of a year without at least a few new tricks.

# Closing Thoughts

My favorite puzzle was day 21. I solved it in R. Part 1 is fairly simple, requiring you
to parse and evaluate a large expression recursively. Part 2 introduces
a nasty escalation: one of the names referenced in the expression (the one labeled
"humn", naturally, since the others refer to monkeys) is bound
to an _unknown_ value, not a constant, and you have to solve for it.

I've always liked expression manipulation. R, with its strong LISP influence,
makes it easy to convert between R code, objects representing the code's
[abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree),
and [S-expression-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) lists
of functions and arguments. So I attacked part 2 by converting the equation to
be solved into a nested list of S-expressions. Since the right side of the
equation resolved to a constant, I could solve it by simply inverting each
operation on the left-hand side until I had isolated the unknown.
I learned later that several other approaches worked well, such as finding the solution
by binary search or using complex-number hackery.
It was fun and rewarding to work through, and the part 2 twist is a classic.

Overall, it was a fun and rewarding year, and I'm mostly pleased with my performance.
I approached puzzles strategically instead of instinctively. I mostly picked the right data structures, and
avoided overengineering my solutions. I knew enough about pathfinding algorithms
to get through the tougher puzzles. Don't get me wrong: I'm a long way
from the people who can crank out an idiomatic Python solution that runs in 50 microseconds
any given day. But I'm improving, and that pleases me.

I had better learn the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) before December 2023, though.
Can't be too hard, right?
