# Verso

This repository contains the source files for my blog, Verso.
You can visit it at [https://ryan-heslin.github.io/](https://ryan-heslin.github.io/).
I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to render posts and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment. For deployment, I use Quarto's recommended [GitHub workflow](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command).
