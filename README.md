# Verso

This repository contains the source files for my blog, Verso.
You can visit it at [https://ryan-heslin.github.io/](https://ryan-heslin.github.io/).
I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to render posts and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment. I use a GitHub workflow developed by [pommevilla](https://github.com/pommevilla/quarto-render).
