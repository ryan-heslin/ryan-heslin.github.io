# TBD

This repository contains the source files for my blog, TBD.
You can visit it at [https://ryan-heslin.github.io/](https://ryan-heslin.github.io/).
I use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to render posts with the [blogdown](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blogdown) package, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
to build the site, and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for deployment.
