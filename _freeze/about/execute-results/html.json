My name is Ryan Heslin, and I recently graduated from\nAmerican University with a master's in data science. While I work in Python\nand a few other languages, my main (and favorite) is R. For now, I'll devote this\nblog to my musings (or ramblings, if you feel uncharitable) on R and other topics\nrelated to data science.\n\n# Why the Name?\nNaming things really is as hard as cache invalidation. I spent a long time casting about for something\nto call the site before hitting on Verso. It means the reverse side of a\nphysical document, such as the left-hand page of a book. The word attracted me\nbecause I aim to make this blog like a good anthology: you can visit any page and find\nsomething short but worth reading.\nAs a publishing term derived from Italian, it has a pleasingly archaic resonance similar to \"quarto\",\nthe namesake of the file format this site's documents are written in. Most important,\nit's got an R.\n\nVerso was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and deployed using Github Pages with\na standard Quarto [GitHub workflow](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command). A previous version of this site was built with rendered Rmarkdown and the\n`blogdown` R package.\n:::\n",
