It's a Tuesday night in autumn 2003. Mark Zuckerberg, a\ncomputer science sophomore at Harvard, is at a tavern on a date with the fictional Erica\nAlbright:\n\n::: {.callout}\nZuckerberg: Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than\nthere are people of any kind living in the United States?\n\nAlbright: That can't possibly be true.\n\nZuckerberg: It is.\n\nAlbright: What would account for that?\n:::\n\nAlbright's intuition is right, though Zuckerberg derails the conversation before she can\nchallenge him further. Some calculations show that Zuckerberg's claim is ridiculous.\n\n# Establishing Numbers\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2003 China had [1.29 billion](https://data.worldbank.org/country/china?view=chart) people and the United States had\n[290,108,000](https://data.worldbank.org/country/united-states?view=chart) (rounding\nto the nearest hundred, not that it matters).\n\nWhile there are many ways to define genius,\nI'll use [intelligence quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient),\na well-known measure that is easy to work with.\nIQ is typically described as normally distributed, with mean 100 and standard\ndeviation about 15. There is no universally accepted cutoff for a \"genius\" IQ.\nTo be charitable, I'll define it as 130 or greater, a mere two standard deviations\nabove the mean.\n\nIf we assume each country has the same theoretical IQ distribution, how many\ngeniuses would we expect in each?\n\n# Calculations\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .source .cell-code}\nus_pop <- 290108000\nchina_pop <- 1290000000\nmu <- 100\nsigma <- 15\ngenius <- 130\ncutoff <- pnorm(genius, mu, sigma, lower.tail = FALSE)\nus_geniuses <- floor(cutoff * us_pop)\nchina_geniuses <- floor(cutoff * china_pop)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe China-US ratio is 4.45, so under these assumptions\nChina has that many times more geniuses.\nBut the ratio of U.S. population to\nChinese geniuses is 9.89. There would need\nto be almost 10 times more Chinese geniuses than there are under these assumptions for\nZuckerberg to be correct. If we\nuse a higher IQ score as the genius cutoff,\nthe ratio gets even worse.\n\nThere are infinitely many implausible IQ\ndistributions that would justify Zuckerberg's claim.\nFor simplicity, let us pose an optimization problem.\nGiven China's actual population and a U.S. mean IQ of 100, how high\nmust China's mean IQ be for Zuckerberg's claim to be correct?\nThat is, what is the lowest mean IQ value\nfor which the right tail area of the normal CDF is greater than\nthe ratio of US to Chinese population?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .source .cell-code}\nvalidate_mean <- function(mu) {\n  floor(pnorm(genius, mu, sigma, lower.tail = FALSE) * china_pop) > us_pop\n}\ngrid <- seq(100, 150, 0.01)\nminimum <- min(grid[validate_mean(grid)])\nminimum\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n-- [1] 118.67\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nZuckerberg's claim would\nrequire the average Chinese to have an IQ\nmore than one standard deviation above the\nU.S. average. I couldn't find reliable\nIQ data for China, and intelligence\nis notoriously hard to measure. But for\nthe claim to be true, the average\nChinese would be more intelligent\nthan about 89.3% of Americans, which is\nunbelievable.\n\nSupposing instead China has the same\nIQ distribution as the United States, how many Chinese would there have to be for Zuckerberg's claim to be correct? This can be solved algebraically:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .source .cell-code}\nfloor(us_pop / cutoff + 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.output}\n-- [1] 12751926040\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat is about 10 times the\nactual 2003 population of China.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn fairness to the real Zuckerberg, this conversation is fictional. As a computer science\nsophomore at an elite university, he likely understood the properties of\nnormal distributions well enough not to make this ridiculous claim. Or maybe\nhe's trying to impress a listener he thinks is naive with nonsense. That's how I've always interpreted Han Solo's  nonsensical claim in _Star Wars_ that the Millennium Falcon can make\nthe Kessel Run in less than twelve [parsecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec).\nEither way, Albright is clearly right.\n\nOne other note:\nDuring the hacking montage that follows the tavern scene, Zuckerberg says\n(in voiceover), \"So it's definitely necessary to break out Emacs and modify that Perl script.\"\nAs a Neovim user, I'm required to remind you it is never necessary to break out\nEmacs.\n",
