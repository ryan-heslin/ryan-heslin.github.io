title: About this Website

My name is Ryan Heslin. I recently graduated with a master's in data science from American University.
While I know Python, SQL, and bits of Lua, my main (and favorite) language is R. This blog is devoted to
discussing R and its quirks, as well as data science generally.
For more odds and ends, visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/ryan-heslin).

Made with the [Blogdown](https://www.rstudio/.com/blogdown) package, which implements the Hugo site generation template. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
I consulted [this book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) while creating this site.
