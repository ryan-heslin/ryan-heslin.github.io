Welcome to my new blog!
My name is Ryan Heslin, and I've just graduated with a master's degree in data science 
from American University. As I do for most of my side projects, I've defined goals for this one. Naturally, I've made those goals sound _just_ compelling enough that I can plausibly deny that working on this thing is procrastination.

Those goals are: 

1. Engage with the wider R community. 
2. Find an outlet for the R esoterica I've learned
3. Learn a web framework, as a first step toward more sophisticated web design 
4. Practice writing, which 
   I find satisfies me the same way coding does

I plan to mostly write about R and other data science topics, though I might broaden scope later on. 
If you've found your way here, I hope at least you're entertained for a little while.
